## What
This generates 'Cards Against Humanity' style cards. Standard poker card sized at ~900DPI.

This is being used to generate a custom printed deck of [DevOps Against Humanity](https://github.com/bridgetkromhout/devops-against-humanity), so the card data is that, and not CAH.

## How
You need `phantomjs` installed. This renders each card as a page in phantom, and saves it as a png.

## Other Shit
The code is horrifying. PhantomJS is fun to work with because it doesn't seem to work with flexbox or any other things that browsers have had for decades.

In the future, it'd probably make more sense to write this as pure javascript and render cards as canvas or some shit. I dunno, I'll probably never work on this again once I get a card run off.

This code is a shitstorm. I can take pull requests I guess.
