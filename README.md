- Adjustable DPI for PNG output. Can also output HTML.
- Reads card data in JSON and XLSX formats.

## Installing
Requires NodeJS 10+

### Help
> cccards --help

## Fonts
CAH is rendered using `Helvetica Neue`, which is a commercial font that cannot be distributed by this project. Cards should also render fine with other sans-serif fonts, but if you want to have authentic looking cards, you will need to obtain `Helvetica Neue` and have it accessible to Chrome.

If you want to know what font is being picked for rendering, you can output html, open it in Chrome, and check in the debug tools which font is being used.

## Card Data

### Blanks
In the `name` field of the card data, a `_` character will be interpreted as a blank line. By default, it will occupy an entire line of the card, along with any text immediately proceeding or following the `_`.

This should suffice for most basic formatting. If you want to pull in text seperated by a space, the easiest way is to use a non-breaking whitespace character (anything pulled into the blank line won't have line breaks anyway). Ex: `Foo&nbsp;_.` will render similar to `Foo _______.` on its own line.

See the 'Given, when, then' card in [cards.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaylynb/cccards/master/example/cards.json) for an example.

#### Manual blanks
Instead of using `_`, you can simply write the generated HTML yourself:

`<div class="underline"><span class="underline">&nbsp;</span></div>`

Anything in the `div` will be on its own line, and anything in the `span` will be underlined. Make sure at least one `&nbsp;` is in the underline span or it won't render an underline at all.

You should also remember to manually specify picks and draws as the autogenerated indicators generate based on `_` chars.

See [cards.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaylynb/cccards/master/example/cards.json) for an example.

Additionally, if you want to manually control the length of the underline, add `manual` to the `span` class and add the number of `&nbsp;` chars for the length desired.

#### Manual Pick & Draw
You may specify `pick` and `draw` counts in the `xlsx`/`json` card data, and it will use those instead of calculating based on `_` char. Useful when manually specifying blanks or when no blanks are present (`Make a Haiku` style CAH cards).
